### When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 


### The game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
### When the player clicks one, the player's score counter will be updated.

### The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

### The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

### The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.


### When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will  have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
